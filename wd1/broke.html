                    France Broke
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Despite everything, Louis XVI was A kind man. 
                    He genuinely felt for the suffering people in his kingdom. 
                    He had already shown his willingness to improve; 
                    prisons like the Bastille were being shut down, and 
                    torture and lettres de cachet were being used less and less.
                    Louis might very well have considered 
                    helping his people by reducing their heavy taxes.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    There was, however, one major problem - France was bankrupt!
                    During the previous 50 years France had been involved in 
                    four major Wars at an estimated cost of 254 million euro. 
                    Rather than cut taxes, Lewis was faced with having find extra money 
                    simply to keep the country going.

                    Estates General Called
                </h1>
                <p>
                    With France in a crisis situation, Louis' finance minister proposed
                    a land tax to raise extra money from the church and Nobles.
                    The response of both the first and second state was outrage.
                    The finance minister was sacked, but those who replaced him could come up with
                    no other solutions to the money crisis.
                    Louis decided that a complete change the entire tax system was needed 
                    and he called a meeting of the estates general to do this. 
                    The estates general was sort of Parliament made up of the 
                    representatives of the first, second and third Estates, 
                    but it hasn't been in 175 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the first and second estates hoped to use the estates general
                    to defend their privileges and perhaps increase them,
                    the third Estate had different ideas. 
                    Fired by the writings of the enlightenment and the 
                    example of the Americans in 1776, the middle class was determined 
                    to seek greater political power and force the church and the Nobles
                    to pay more taxes period.
                    Many ordinary peasants and workers pinned their hopes
                    on the Estates general also, believing that if the church and nobles
                    were forced to pay more taxes, then everyone else would would have
                    to pay less.
                    The opening of the estates general purpose of May 5th, 1789.

                    Tennis Court Oath
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Throughout France the third estate outnumbered the first and second Estates.
                    This meant that it could out vote the combined numbers of the church and Nobles.
                    Of course, the first and second Estates realised this could be damaging for them. 
                    Thus, they proposed to vote as groups.
                    This would mean the first and second Estates could join together to 
                    defeat the third Estate every time. 
                    Thus, the third Estate would be left with even less power than it already had and
                    probably a lot more taxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the start the third Estate deputies refused to do this.
                    As a result, the estates-general did nothing for some 6 weeks.
                    The first and second Estates refused to attend a single meeting with the third 
                    estate, where they would be out voted. On June 17th and 3rd state voted to
                    form itself into a national assembly regardless of whether the other is States joined it or not. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The determination of the third Estate to achieve their aims grew
                    when they were locked out of their meeting place on the morning of June 20th.
                    Members moved instead the nearby royal tennis court and took the tennis court oath.
                    King Louis XVI was uncertain what to do next you wanted change, but he was weak,
                    and was being pressurized by Marie Antoinette and the Nobles who wanted the assembly broken up.
                    Louis sent a messenger to the assembly, calling on its members to disperse,
                    return to the estates general and vote by group. They refused to comply
                    and Louis was forced to give his support to the assembly.
