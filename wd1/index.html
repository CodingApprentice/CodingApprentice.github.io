                <p>
                    One of the great revolutions of the eighteenth century took place in France from 1789 onwards.
                    The background causes of the revolution were varied and complex; detailing them,
                    involves having to go back many, many years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the rest of Europe, France, since the Middle ages, had a feudal system of government.
                    Hence, absolute power lay in the hands of a monarch and nobles.
                    In 1789, the King of France was Louis XVI; the political system 
                    which he led was the <i lang="fr">Ancien Regime</i>.

                    French Nobility
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Nobels of the <i lang="fr">Ancien Regime</i> were made up of two groups,
                    the first being the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, otherwise known as the First Estate.
                    The Catholic Church had remained very strong in France since the Reformation, owning
                    large estates and having had many churchmen rise to positions of power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other branch of nobility was made up of great landowners such as dukes, counts,
                    barons and marquises. They were often called the aristocracy or Second Estate.
                    They too were wealthy and powerful. Most of the positions in the French government, army and courts
                    were filled by members of the Second Estate.

                    Taxes
                </h1>
                <p>
                    On top of the privileges that the First and Second Estates enjoyed,
                    they also paid very little in tax, if at all.The Church only gave donations,
                    and was never asked to give more than it desired to, and nobles paid very small taxes
                    called capitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bulk of taxes were paid by the poor peasants in the countryside and by the workers 
                    in the cities. To the state, peasants paid a crippling land tax, to the Church, a tax called a tithe.
                    Furthermore, peasants were forced to pay high prices for food and other goods because of duties
                    placed on these by the state. In addition to all these taxes, peasants had to pay rent to their 
                    aristocratic landlords, and several days a year were obliged to carry out free repair work on 
                    their local roads. Moreover, many peasants were obliged to buy their flour 
                    and wine from their noble landlords, regardless of costs.
